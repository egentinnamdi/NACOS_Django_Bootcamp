Paper: Use this when you want a visually distinct "card" or "surface" look with built-in elevation (shadows) to make it appear as if it's floating or raised from the background. Ideal for things like cards, dialog boxes, or any surface that should stand out from the rest of the page.

Typical Layout Flow
When structuring a page, the usual flow would be:

Container: Start by wrapping your entire page or section inside a Container to keep things centered and limit the width.
Grid or Box: Inside the container, you can then use a Grid (for more structured, column-based layouts) or Box (for more flexible, free-form layouts) to organize your content.
