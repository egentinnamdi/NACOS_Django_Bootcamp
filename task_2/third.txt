Why Start with the Container Component?
Consistency: It provides a consistent margin around your content, making sure that the content doesnâ€™t stretch too wide on large screens.
Centering: By default, the content inside a Container is centered horizontally.
Responsiveness: The Container supports breakpoints (xs, sm, md, lg, xl), so you can control how wide the content should be on different screen sizes.
Readability: Without a container, the content could stretch across the entire width of the screen, which can make it hard to read on wide displays.
